Project Oriented Programming is a club dedicated to learning how to program in Python!

Since BSGE is phasing out its computer science course, we want to create a club to help educate people who want to learn how to code. We welcome people of all coding levels.

> Our Google Classroom code will be emailed to all and posted here. Please use DOE emails to sign up.
> 
> Regular meetings are beginning after break, on **Tuesdays**

## What will we be doing anyways?
This club will be teaching:

Along the way, we'll be putting our coding skills to practice and hopefully participating in some hackathons!
