# Project Oriented Programming

Project Oriented Programming is a club dedicated to learning how to program in Python!

Since BSGE is phasing out its computer science course, we want to create a club to help educate people who want to learn how to code. We welcome people of all coding levels.

> Our Google Classroom code will be emailed to all and posted here. Please use DOE emails to sign up.
> 
> Regular meetings are beginning after break, on **Tuesdays**

## Upcoming Meetings

- 02/14: In-person interest meeting after school in the cafeteria
- 02/17 & 02/19: Informal meetings @2:30 PM on Zoom.
- 02/27: Our first real meeting! Location undetermined.

*Note: You are NOT required to go to all meetings or any interest meetings to join this club.*

## What will we be doing anyways?
This club will be teaching:
- Python basics
- Using libraries and APIs

Along the way, we'll be putting our coding skills to practice and hopefully participating in some hackathons!
