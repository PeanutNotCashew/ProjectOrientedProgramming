Project Oriented Programming is a club dedicated to learning how to program in Python!

Since BSGE is phasing out its computer science course, we want to create a club to help educate people who want to learn how to code. We welcome people of all coding levels.

> Join our [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/c/NjYzNDA1OTQ3MzM4?cjc=4ebfpu6)!
> 
> Regular meetings are beginning after break, on **Tuesdays** in room 300.

*Note: You are NOT required to go to all meetings or any interest meetings to join this club.*

<br>

## What will we be doing anyways?
This club will be teaching:
- Python basics
- Using libraries and APIs

Along the way, we'll be putting our coding skills to practice and hopefully participating in some hackathons!
